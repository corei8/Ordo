Only Feasts of Double Rite of the First of Second Claass are transerred, when impeded by a nobler Office, to the first day following that is not occupied bu another Feast of teh First or Second Class, an occurring Sunday, a Privileged Vigil, or any Office that excludes Feasts of the First or Second Class respectively.

**476.**

In transferring Feasts of the First and Second Class, their claims to Pre-eminence must be considered, namely:

1. The higher rite,
2. The greater solemnity, *i.e.* whether one is celebrated with the obligation of resting from servile work (with precept), or with an Octave, 
3. The quality of Primary or Secondary Feasts,
4. The dignity. The dignity of the person of a saint, in the final analysis, is to be sought in the order in which the Saints are inscribed in the Litany,
5. The quality of Proper in Feasts.
