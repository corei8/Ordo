# RomanCalendar

Pre-Vatican II Roman Catholic Calendar with proper readings indicated for the Divine Office.

### Python Specifications

Python3

No external modules thus far

### How it Works

The temporal cycle is generated by a funtion as a list. The sanctoral cycle is proper to each diocese and is combined with the temporal cycle after the latter is generated.
The result is a list containing:

1. A liturgical calendar proper to an indicated diocese;
2. Indications of the peculiarities of the office of that day;
3. An ordo for the Mass of that day, or multiple Masses, if there be options for that day.

### Will there be an online version?

Yes. I am going to make a GitHub Pages version available after the core of the project is up and running.

### How to Help

Submissions for sanctoral cycles are not yet open, but will be soon. I am still trying to figure out the easiest way to store and use the data.
