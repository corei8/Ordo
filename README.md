### How it Works

The temporal cycle is generated by a funtion as a list. The sanctoral cycle is proper to each diocese and is combined with the temporal cycle after the latter is generated.

The result is a list containing:

1. A liturgical calendar proper to an indicated diocese;
2. Indications of the peculiarities of the office of that day;
3. An ordo for the Mass of that day, or multiple Masses, if there be options for that day.
