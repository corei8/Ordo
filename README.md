## Overview

The temporal cycle is generated by a funtion as a dictionary. The sanctoral cycle is made up of several files for country, region and diocese, and each file is a pre-built dictionary. These are combined with the temporal cycle after the latter is generated.

The result is a dictionary containing:

1. A liturgical calendar proper to an specified diocese (or several dioceses);
2. Indications of the peculiarities of the office of that day;
3. An ordo for the Mass of that day, or multiple Masses, if applicable.

Easter is the first feast (every 'event' is treated as a feast) to be determined, since most of the liturgical year depends upon the date of Easter. Christmas, being static with regard to its date, requires that we only find the day of the week on which it falls. We begin building the temporal calendar with 01-01.
